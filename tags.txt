# Git tags
---------------
Tagging in GIT is: to create specific points in history of your repository/data
This is usually done to mark release points.
Example: your product is stable and you want to mark it as release 1.0, you can create atag for that.

STEP 1: Checkout the branch where you want to create tags.
	>> git checkout <branchname>
	>> git tag v1.0
      OR i can use annotated tags
	>> git tag -a v1.0 -m "This is release version 1"

STEP 2: Display or show tags
	>> git tag
	>> git show <tagname>
	>> git tag -l "tagname.*" # Wild card
